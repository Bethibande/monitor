# extension-template
This is a template for an extension.
Use copy this template if you want to create a new extension.

> [!WARNING]
> Extensions are still under heavy development, this template might change at any time.
> Changes to the extension API might break any existing extensions.

### Development
To register the extension, configure and apply the `MonitorFederatedExtension.yaml` file to your local test cluster.
Once you have done that, start the application and the gateway should have registered your extension.
